# MOFAI Lab: Mathematics of Artificial Intelligence

**M**athematics of **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence (MOFAI) Lab is based at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en).  
As the name of the lab suggests, we focus on understanding the mathematical structures and algorithms that drive advancements in artificial intelligence. 
We explore mathematical principles, ranging from algebra to calculus, probability theory, and optimization, all of which form the foundation of AI technologies. Additionally, we develop innovative tools and collaborate with experts in various fields, including machine learning and data science, to push the boundaries of AI research.Our goal is to contribute to the field of AI by deepening the understanding of its mathematical core and providing the groundwork for the next generation of AI technologies.
